# Swift-tutorial
### Personal study project

Just a first tutorial project with Swift. You can download and test it out if you would like. 

The project is a result of video [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oT32JUH1s0&list=PLMRqhzcHGw1YqPh-ggQHJPAUxdHov_uNJ&index=11) lessons ðŸ˜€
I just tried to use different approach other than you will see in the video.
